React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries used for building user interfaces. The way React updates the UI is based on the concept of the Virtual DOM. It means the Virtual DOM is a representation of the real DOM, any changes made to it allows React to determine what changes need to be made to the real DOM. However, even though there is no direct interaction between the component and the real DOM, a component itself goes through several stages in its lifecycle. One significant aspect of React is understanding the lifecycle of a component. It can help you optimize, manage the state, and do other things that will make your component work perfectly. 

### The Lifecycle Stages 
React components have a lifecycle that consists of several stages. Each stage is an opportunity to update the state of the component. There are three phases of a React component:
- Mounting
- Updating, and
- Unmounting.

After the component is mounted, it goes through several phases where events take place. Here we will discuss each stage of the lifecycle and the methods that are called with their examples.

#### Mounting
Mounting means when a component is created and displayed on the screen. The following methods are used:

##### constructor()
The constructor method is where you initialize the state of the component, this is called once when the component is first created. 

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      message: "Hello World!",
    };
  }
  render() {
   // Your JSX here
  }
}
```

##### render()
The render() method is called every time you update the state or whenever a change happens in the input props. Basically, every time the component re-renders, this method is called. 

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.props.value}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

##### componentDidMount()
The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is mounted, and it runs only once. So this is called right after the initial rendering of the component and its children.

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Component mounted successfully!");
  }
  render() {
   // Your JSX here
  }
}
```

#### Updating
Updating means when a component is being re-rendered with new data. The following methods are used:

##### shouldComponentUpdate()
shouldComponentUpdate() is a lifecycle method that helps you decide whether your component needs to be re-rendered or not. It returns a Boolean value, true if it needs to be re-rendered and false if it does not.

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    // Your logic here
  }
  render() {
   // Your JSX here
  }
}
```

##### componentDidUpdate()
componentDidUpdate() is called right after the rendering of the component when there is an update in its state or prop values. Here, you can check the difference between the previous and current state and perform other operations accordingly. 

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // Perform state related operations
  }
  render() {
   // Your JSX here
  }
}
```

#### Unmounting
Unmounting means when a component is removed from the screen. The following method is used:

##### componentWillUnmount()
componentWillUnmount() runs before the component is removed from the screen or before the component is destroyed. It is called once throughout the component’s lifecycle. 

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Any cleanup actions
  }
  render() {
   // Your JSX here
  }
}
```

### Recap
In this blog post, we explored the basics of React component lifecycle. The component lifecycle consists of three phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. React components have some lifecycle methods that get called in each of these phases. We also saw the example of the lifecycle methods constructor(), render(), componentDidMount(), shouldComponentUpdate(), componentDidUpdate(), and componentWillUnmount(). Understanding these lifecycle methods and using them in the right way can help you better manage the state and optimize your components.
