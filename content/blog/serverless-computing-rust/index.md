Serverless computing is a rapidly growing trend in the world of cloud computing, and for good reason. Instead of having to worry about infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance, serverless computing allows developers to simply focus on writing and deploying code. One of the most popular serverless computing platforms is AWS Lambda, which allows developers to deploy functions that run on-demand, without having to worry about server configuration or management.

But what if you could run your serverless functions with Rust? Rust is a fast, efficient and powerful programming language that has gained popularity in recent years, particularly for network programming, system-level programming, and gaming development. 

In this article, we’ll explore why Rust is a great choice for serverless computing with AWS Lambda and how to deploy a Rust function on AWS Lambda. 

## Benefits of Rust for Serverless Computing

### Low Cold Start Times

One of the biggest concerns with serverless computing is cold start times - the time it takes for a function to execute for the first time after being invoked. This latency can be mitigated by keeping the runtime warm, but that can be costly and complex to manage. 

Fortunately, Rust has a low startup time, which means cold start times for Rust functions are also low. This makes Rust a great choice for serverless functions that require a fast response time.

### Efficiency

Rust is known for its efficiency, which means it can handle more requests per second compared to other languages like Python or Node.js. This efficiency translates to cost-effectiveness because a serverless function can handle more requests without requiring additional compute resources, which results in cost savings.

### Type Safety and Memory Safety

Rust is a compiled language that enforces type and memory safety at compile time, which reduces the likelihood of runtime errors and vulnerabilities. This feature is especially valuable for serverless functions since they may run in untrusted environments and handle sensitive data.

### Great for Network and System Level Programming

Rust's has a strong focus on networking and system-level programming, making it a great choice for serverless functions that require low-level access to the system. This lends itself well to use cases like image processing or network request handling.

## How to Deploy a Rust Function on AWS Lambda

Now that we've discussed the benefits of using Rust for serverless computing, we'll walk through how to deploy a Rust function on AWS Lambda.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

* Rust
* Docker
* The AWS CLI 

### Creating a New Rust Project

First, we’ll create a new Rust project using the `cargo` command-line tool:

```bash
$ cargo new my-serverless-function --bin
$ cd my-serverless-function
```

This generates a new Rust project with the following structure:

```bash
my-serverless-function
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
```

### Adding Dependencies

Next, we’ll add some dependencies to our `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
lambda_runtime = "0.3.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

* `lambda_runtime` is the AWS Lambda runtime for Rust.
* `tokio` is an async runtime for multi-threaded programming.
* `serde_json` is a JSON library that we’ll use to parse and deserialize Lambda event requests.

### Writing the Function

Now, we’ll write a simple Rust function that takes a JSON payload and returns a JSON response:

```rust
use lambda_runtime::{handler_fn, Context};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use serde_json::{json, Value};
use std::error::Error;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct CustomEvent {
    first_name: String,
    last_name: String,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct CustomOutput {
    message: String,
}

type Error = Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync + 'static>;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let func = handler_fn(hello);
    lambda_runtime::run(func).await?;
    Ok(())
}

async fn hello(event: CustomEvent, _: Context) -> Result<CustomOutput, Error> {
    Ok(CustomOutput {
        message: format!("Hello, {}!", event.first_name),
    })
}
```

This function receives a request payload, extracts the `first_name` field, then returns a response payload containing a personalized message.

### Building and Packaing the Function

Before deploying the function to AWS Lambda, we need to build and package it as a deployable zip file. We'll do that by first building for the `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` target to ensure our code is compatible with the Lambda runtime environment:

```bash
$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

### Deploying to AWS Lambda

Now, we're ready to deploy our function to AWS Lambda. We'll use the AWS CLI to aid in the deployment process:

```bash
$ aws lambda create-function --function-name my-serverless-function \
--role <arn-of-execution-role> \
--handler doesnt.matter \
--timeout 30 \
--zip-file fileb://target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/my-serverless-function.zip \
--runtime provided \
--tracing-config Mode=Active

```
Here, we are creating a new function named `my-serverless-function` and providing the path to our Rust package. 

### Invoking the Function

We can now invoke our Rust serverless function via the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS CLI:

```bash
$ aws lambda invoke --function-name my-serverless-function --payload '{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Doe"}' output.txt
$ cat output.txt
```

This will return a response with the message we returned in our Rust function.

## Conclusion 

Rust is a great language to use for serverless computing because of its low cold start times, efficiency, type and memory safety, and system-level programming abilities. By leveraging the AWS Lambda Rust runtime, we can easily deploy and run Rust functions as serverless applications on AWS.
