React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. Together, they can be used to build complex, dynamic user interfaces that respond to user interactions and manage state more efficiently.

Before diving into the example, let's briefly cover the basics of React and Redux.

## The Basics of React

React was created by Facebook and is widely used for building user interfaces. It allows developers to break down the UI into reusable components, making it easier to manage complexity. React can be used to build everything from single-page applications (SPAs) to large-scale web apps.

A React component is a self-contained unit of code that handles a specific piece of the UI. It can be as simple or as complex as needed, and can be rendered as a child component of other components. React components can be stateful or stateless, meaning that they can either have a state object that stores data or not.

## The Basics of Redux

Redux is a state management library that is used to manage the flow of data in a JavaScript application. It provides a centralized store that holds the application's data in a predictable, immutable way. Redux can be used with any UI library, though it is most commonly used with React.

The principles of Redux are grounded in three main concepts:

- **Store**: This is where the application's state is held. The store is an immutable object, meaning that it cannot be modified directly.
- **Actions**: Actions are payloads of information that send data from the application to the store.
- **Reducers**: Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to an action. They take the current state and an action as input and return a new state object as output.

## Integrating React and Redux

To integrate React and Redux, we need to install the necessary packages and set up our project accordingly. Here's a basic outline of the steps we need to take:

1. Install the required packages using `npm` or `yarn`:
```bash
npm install react redux react-redux
```

2. Create a `store.js` file to hold our store configuration:
```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers/index';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

export default store;
```

3. Create your reducers in the `reducers` directory:
```javascript
const initialState = {
    count: 0
}

function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
    switch(action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
            return { count: state.count + 1 }
        case 'DECREMENT':
            return { count: state.count - 1 }
        default:
            return state
    }
}

export default counterReducer;
```

4. Create your actions in the `actions` directory:
```javascript
export const incrementCounter = () => {
    return {
        type: 'INCREMENT'
    }
}

export const decrementCounter = () => {
    return {
        type: 'DECREMENT'
    }
}
```

5. Create a `App.js` file to hold our React components:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { incrementCounter, decrementCounter } from './actions';

function App(props) {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{props.count}</h1>
            <button onClick={props.incrementCounter}>+</button>
            <button onClick={props.decrementCounter}>-</button>
        </div>
    )
}

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
    count: state.count
})

const mapDispatchToProps = { incrementCounter, decrementCounter }

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App);
```

Here, we've created a simple example of a counter component that uses Redux to manage state. Note how we use the `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` functions to connect Redux to our React component.

## Creating a Dynamic UI with React and Redux

Now that we've covered the basics, let's dive into an example of how to create a dynamic user interface using React and Redux.

For this example, we'll create a simple to-do list that allows us to add and remove items. The completed items will be displayed with a strikethrough text decoration. Let's start by creating our Redux store and reducers:

```javascript
const initialState = {
    todos: []
}

function todoReducer(state = initialState, action) {
    switch(action.type) {
        case 'ADD_TODO':
            return { todos: [...state.todos, action.payload] }
        case 'REMOVE_TODO':
            return { todos: [...state.todos.filter(t => t.id !== action.payload.id)] }
        case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
            return { todos: [...state.todos.map(t => t.id === action.payload.id ? {...t, completed: !t.completed} : t)] }
        default:
            return state
    }
}

export default todoReducer;
```

```javascript
export const addTodo = todo => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_TODO',
    payload: todo
  }
}

export const removeTodo = id => {
  return {
    type: 'REMOVE_TODO',
    payload: { id }
  }
}

export const toggleTodoCompletion = id => {
  return {
    type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',
    payload: { id }
  }
}
```

We have three actions - `ADD_TODO`, `REMOVE_TODO`, and `TOGGLE_TODO` - that correspond to adding a new todo, removing an existing todo, and toggling the completion status of a todo respectively. All of these actions will take a `payload` parameter that contains the relevant data for that action.

Now let's create our `App.js` file:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { addTodo, removeTodo, toggleTodoCompletion } from './actions';

function App(props) {
    const [todoText, setTodoText] = useState('');

    function handleSubmit(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        props.addTodo({ id: Date.now(), text: todoText, completed: false });
        setTodoText('');
    }

    function handleToggle(id) {
        props.toggleTodoCompletion(id)
    }

    function handleDelete(todo) {
        props.removeTodo(todo.id);
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>To-Do List</h1>
            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
                <input type="text" value={todoText} onChange={e => setTodoText(e.target.value)} /><button type="submit">Add</button>
            </form>
            <ul>
                {props.todos.map(todo => (
                        <li key={todo.id} onClick={() => handleToggle(todo.id)} style={{ textDecoration: todo.completed ? 'line-through' : '' }}>
                            {todo.text} <button onClick={() => handleDelete(todo)}>Delete</button>
                        </li>
                    )
                )}
            </ul>
        </div>
    )
}

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
    todos: state.todos
})

const mapDispatchToProps = { addTodo, removeTodo, toggleTodoCompletion }

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App);
```

In this example, we've created a UI for the to-do list that includes a form to add new to-dos and a list to display existing to-dos. We've also included functionality to remove to-dos and toggle their completion status.

Notice that we use `mapStateToProps` to map the state of our store to our component's props. We also use `mapDispatchToProps` to map our Redux actions to our component's props. Finally, we connect our component to Redux using the `connect` function.

This example provides a basic structure for building dynamic user interfaces with React and Redux. As you develop more complex applications, you may find that you need to expand upon these concepts or find alternative approaches to managing state in your application. However, by establishing a solid foundation with React and Redux, you'll be better equipped to create dynamic UIs that are both predictable and user-friendly.
