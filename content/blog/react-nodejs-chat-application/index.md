## Introduction
Web-based chat applications have become increasingly popular in recent years due to the rise of real-time communication platforms. In this tutorial, we will be building a chat application from scratch using React and Node.js. React is a powerful front-end library used for building user interfaces, while Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and efficient applications.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:
- Node.js and npm
- Git
- A text editor of your choice (e.g. VS Code)

## Setting Up the Project
To create our chat application, we will need to create two separate projects - one for the front-end and one for the back-end. We will be using Create React App for the front-end and Express.js for the back-end.

### Creating the Front-end Project
To create the front-end project, open up a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
npx create-react-app client
cd client
npm start
```

This will create a new React project called "client" and start the development server at http://localhost:3000.

### Creating the Back-end Project
To create the back-end project, open up another terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir server
cd server
npm init -y
npm install express cors mongoose socket.io
```

This will create a new Node.js project called "server" and install the necessary dependencies for our chat application.

## Building the Front-end
Now that we have our front-end project set up, let's start building out the user interface.

### Setting Up the Router
We will be using React Router to handle routing within our application. Create a new file called "App.js" in the "client/src" directory and add the following code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

import Login from './components/Login';
import Chat from './components/Chat';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Login} />
        <Route path="/chat" component={Chat} />
      </Switch>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This will set up our routes for the login and chat pages.

### Creating the Login Component
Create a new file called "Login.js" in the "client/src/components" directory and add the following code:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';

function Login() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const history = useHistory();

  function handleLogin() {
    if (username.trim() !== '') {
      history.push('/chat?username=' + username);
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="username">Username:</label>
      <input
        type="text"
        id="username"
        value={username}
        onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Login;
```

This will create the login component with a simple form for the user to enter their username.

### Creating the Chat Component
Create a new file called "Chat.js" in the "client/src/components" directory and add the following code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import io from 'socket.io-client';

function Chat(props) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const socketRef = useRef();
  const username = new URLSearchParams(props.location.search).get('username');

  useEffect(() => {
    socketRef.current = io.connect('http://localhost:5000');

    socketRef.current.on('message', (message) => {
      setMessages([...messages, message]);
    });

    return () => {
      socketRef.current.disconnect();
    };
  }, [messages]);

  function handleSendMessage() {
    socketRef.current.emit('message', { username, message });
    setMessage('');
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Welcome {username}</h2>
      <div>
        {messages.map((message, index) => (
          <div key={index}>
            {message.username}: {message.message}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Type your message here..."
        value={message}
        onChange={(e) => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={handleSendMessage}>Send</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Chat;
```

This will create the chat component, which will handle sending and receiving messages to and from the server using sockets.

## Building the Back-end
Now that we have our front-end set up, let's move on to building the back-end.

### Creating the Server
Create a new file called "server.js" in the "server" directory and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const socketio = require('socket.io');
const http = require('http');

const Message = require('./models/message');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketio(server);

app.use(cors());

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/chat', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('User connected');

  socket.on('message', (data) => {
    console.log('Message received:', data);

    const message = new Message({ username: data.username, message: data.message });
    message.save().then(() => {
      io.emit('message', { username: data.username, message: data.message });
    });
  });

  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('User disconnected');
  });
});

server.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log('Server started at http://localhost:5000');
});
```

This will create the server with sockets for sending and receiving messages.

### Creating the Message Model
Create a new file called "message.js" in the "server/models" directory and add the following code:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const messageSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    username: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    message: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
  },
  {
    timestamps: true,
  }
);

const Message = mongoose.model('Message', messageSchema);

module.exports = Message;
```

This will create the message model for storing messages in the database.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we went through the process of building a web-based chat application using React and Node.js. We covered everything from setting up the development environment to implementing real-time chat functionality using sockets. By the end of this post, you should have a good understanding of how to create a full-stack web application with real-time chat capabilities.
