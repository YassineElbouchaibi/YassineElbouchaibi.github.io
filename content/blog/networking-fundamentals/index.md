Computer networking is fundamental to modern-day computing. It enables computers to communicate with each other, share resources and access the internet. In this article, we explore the foundations of computer networking and what you need to know to understand how networks work.


## TCP/IP Protocol

The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a set of communication protocols used to connect devices to the internet. TCP is responsible for breaking up data into packets, ensuring they are transmitted reliably, and in the correct order. IP is responsible for addressing and routing the packets to their destination.

Let's take a practical example, using Linux commands, to demonstrate how TCP/IP protocols work. Run the following command on the terminal:

```
ping google.com
```

This command sends an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packet to the google.com server, requesting a response. The server responds with ICMP packets containing data, that is then received by the user's computer. The TCP protocol ensures that the packets are received and assembled in the correct order, while the IP protocol ensures that the packets are correctly addressed and routed.

## Network Protocols

Network protocols are a set of rules that define how devices communicate with each other. In addition to TCP/IP, there are numerous other networking protocols. These protocols operate at different layers of the OSI model (discussed below) and are responsible for different functions, such as addressing, routing, and error detection.

As an example, let's use the Linux command `traceroute` to see the network protocols at work. Running `traceroute google.com` on the terminal will output the path or "hops" that packets take from the user's device to the google.com server. This command uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to trace the network path, demonstrating the functions of different network protocols.

## OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model that defines how devices communicate with each other. The model consists of seven layers, each of which performs a specific function in the communication process.

The seven layers of the OSI model are as follows:

1. Physical layer: Deals with the physical aspects of data transmission, such as cables, connectors, and electrical signals.

2. Data link layer: Responsible for transmitting data between adjacent network nodes and error detection and correction.

3. Network layer: Responsible for addressing, routing and congestion control. Let's demonstrate the network layer using Linux commands. Running the command `ifconfig` on the terminal will display information about network interfaces on the user's device, including their IP addresses and network masks.

4. Transport layer: Provides reliable data transfer services and handles end-to-end error recovery and flow control.

5. Session layer: Responsible for creating and maintaining sessions between applications running on different devices.

6. Presentation layer: Translates between different data formats and provides data encryption and compression.

7. Application layer: Provides services to end-users such as web browsing, email and file transfer.


## IP Addresses

IP addresses are unique identifiers assigned to network devices. There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses consist of 32 bits and are represented as four decimal numbers separated by dots, such as 192.168.0.1. IPv6 addresses, on the other hand, consist of 128 bits and are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons.

In conclusion, computer networking is a vast and essential field that enables modern-day computing. Understanding the fundamentals of networking, such as TCP/IP, network protocols, the OSI model, and IP addresses, is crucial for anyone interested in computer science or software development. Using Linux commands to understand these fundamental concepts provides a technical insight into how computer networking works in the real world.
